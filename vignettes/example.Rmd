Example use of CASSO and fine-tuning parameters

```{Example use in swiss-data with gaussian family}

# Use example swiss-data for quickness
library(casso)
data(swiss)
fit <- casso(x=swiss[,-1], y=swiss[,1], family="mse")

# Plot model coefficients as a function of cardinality k
plot(fit) 

```

Fit model object can be inspected based on visual diagnostics such as cross-validation and bootstrapping:

```{Cross-validation}

# Perform 10-fold cross-validation to find out optimal k
cv <- cv.casso(fit, fold=10, seed=0)
# Visualize model generalization performance as a function of k
cv.visu(cv)

```

Appears that k-values 3 or 4 saturate the model, with no further coefficients contributing to the model's generalization capability. Further, there is some uncertainty as to what order the coefficients should be non-zero, based on bootstrapping:

```{Bootstrapping}

# Bootstrap original data 25 times (sampling with replacement and refitting)
bs <- bs.casso(fit, bootstrap=25, seed=0)
# Visualize trajectories of bootstrapped coefficients
bs.visu(bs)

```

Useful commands for understanding the model and the casso object:

```{Tools}

coef(fit, k=3) # All potential coefficients at cardinality k=3
feat(fit, k=3) # All features chosen at cardinality k=3

```

\title{oscar: Optimal Subset Cardinality Regression}
\description{
OSCAR models utilize the L0-pseudonorm to select an optimal subset of features that generalizes linear regression models to a variety of families. Currently supported models include conventional Gaussian regression (family="mse" or family="gaussian"), Binomial/Logistic regression (family="logistic"), and Cox proportional hazards modeling (family="cox").

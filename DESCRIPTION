Description: Optimal Subset Cardinality Regression (OSCAR) models offer
    regularized linear regression using the L0-pseudonorm, conventionally
    known as the number of non-zero coefficients. The package estimates an
    optimal subset of features using the L0-penalization via
    cross-validation, bootstrapping and visual diagnostics. Effective
    Fortran implementations are offered along the package for finding
    optima for the DC-decomposition, which is used for transforming the
    discrete L0-regularized optimization problem into a continuous
    non-convex optimization task. These optimization modules include DBDC
    ('Double Bundle method for nonsmooth DC optimization' as described in
    Joki et al. (2018) <doi:10.1137/16M1115733>) and LMBM ('Limited
    Memory Bundle Method for large-scale nonsmooth optimization' as
    in Haarala et al. (2004) <doi:10.1080/10556780410001689225>).
    Multiple regression model families are supported: Cox, logistic,
    and Gaussian.

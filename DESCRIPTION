Description: 
	Optimal Subset Cardinality Regression (OSCAR) models offer regularized linear regression using the L0-pseudonorm, 
	conventionally known as the number of non-zero coefficients. The package estimates an optimal subset of features 
	using the L0-penalization via cross-validation, bootstrapping and visual diagnostics. Effective Fortran implementations
	are offered along the package for finding optima for the DC-decomposition, which is used for transforming the discrete 
	L0-regularized optimization problem into a continuous non-convex optimization task. These optimization modules include 
	DBDC and LMBM methods. Multiple regression model families are supported: Cox, logistic, and Gaussian.
